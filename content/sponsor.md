I'm the current maintainer of [Vibrancy Continued](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued), an extension that enables transparency for VSCode with 200k+ downloads to date. I also write and share various open-source software that helps many people solve their problems with ease, such as [Annemone](https://github.com/illixion/Annemone), [Root My WebOS TV](https://github.com/illixion/root-my-webos-tv) and [StreamDeck Animated Screensaver](https://github.com/illixion/StreamDeck-Animated-Screensaver). Additionally, I run a this blog where I share knowledge I've gained while solving problems I've encountered in my own journey, which is read by many thousands of people every month.

Here you can see the list of my sponsors on GitHub, as well as the option to become a sponsor and/or donate once. Your support is always super appreciated, and thank you for the consideration.
