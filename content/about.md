Hello and welcome to this technoblog! I'm Manual and I pretend to be a cat on the internet, but IRL I'm a software developer, DevOps connoisseur and cybersecurity fanatic also known as [***REMOVED*** ***REMOVED***](https://***REMOVED***.me).

You can find all of my open-source work on [my GitHub](https://github.com/manualmanul).

My portfolio is currently not available due to most of my "professional" work being under an NDA or other limitations.
